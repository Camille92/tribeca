### KNOWN BUGS:

1. Occasionnaly trades would not be correclty cancelled.
   After looking at it, It seems more likely that a trade can be left behind when tribeca crashes.
    (Seems like OkCoin is prone to failure, but Coinbase does not suffer from this bug)

2. Under EwmaBasic, when the TBP reaches 0 or the total size of the portfolio, it gets stuck there forever.
   Actually, I think that tribeca keeps adding a value to EwmaBasic even when it reaches 0 or the size of portfolio even if it not shown.
    (not sure if a bug or a feature, pending investigation!)

3. Orders do not last more than a few miliseconds on OkCoin.
    (confirmed, needs investigation)

4. Browserify does not minify es6 yet, so bundle.min.js is not really minified.
    (roadmap at https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/448#issuecomment-245936071)

5. ag-grid css is also not minified.

6. TradesComponent.addRowData does not sort updated records (but is harmless so low priority).

7. Display components of ag-grid have all scoped variables published instead of just the public expected ones for the visible grid cells (useless ui bandwidth in all 3 ag-grid).

### TODO:

-1. Concurrent exchanges

0. Display charts

1. Add new exchanges

2. Add new, smarter trading strategies (as always!)

3. Support for currency pairs which do not trade in $0.01 increments (LTC, DOGE)

4. More documentation

5. More performant UI
