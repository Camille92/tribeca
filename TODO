### KNOWN BUGS:

1. Under EwmaBasic, when the TBP reaches 0 or the total size of the portfolio, it gets stuck there forever.
   Actually, I think that tribeca keeps adding a value to EwmaBasic even when it reaches 0 or the size of portfolio even if it not shown.
    (not sure if a bug or a feature, pending investigation!)

3. ag-grid css is also not minified.

### TODO:

-1. Concurrent exchanges

0. Display charts

1. Add new exchanges

2. Add new, smarter trading strategies (as always!)

3. Support for currency pairs which do not trade in $0.01 increments (LTC, DOGE)

4. More documentation

5. More performant UI
